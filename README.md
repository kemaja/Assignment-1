Assignment 1

Focus: Structure and construction of digital platforms (HTML, CSS, JavaScript connections)

Task

Create a simple web page that demonstrates the connection between:

● HTML

● CSS

● JavaScript

Then explain how these components interact to form a basic digital platform.


Instructions

1. Create a new repository on Github called Assignment 1 (OBS! Make sure the repository has it’s privacy setting set to Public so I can access it)

2. Setup the new repository in GitHub desktop

3. In the local repository, create a new WebStorm project and use the HTML5 Boilerplate template

4. Create an index.html file with a simple structure (header, main content, footer).

5. Link a style.css file and add basic styling (for example: colors, fonts)

6. Link a app.js file that adds a small interactive feature (for example: a button that changes text or displays the current time)

7. As comments in the code write, alternatively; write the comments in the README markdown file:

○ How the HTML, CSS, and JS files are connected

○ What happens when a user loads the page (code flow)

○ What role each file plays in the platform


VG requirement:

Make your JavaScript code interact dynamically with the page by:

● Selecting and modifying elements in the DOM (for example: add/remove elements, generate HTML elements from a JavaScript list)

● Explaining in comments or in the README file how the browser processes these changes when a user interacts with the page, both frontend and backend (for example: explain the whole code flow from pressing the button to adding element)
